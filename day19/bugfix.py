# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# The following program produces the same exact web app which we built in today's coding exercise.
# The only difference is that the code has been refactored (i.e., better organized) by moving
# the grayscale functionality into a function in a separate converter.py file:
#
# converter.py:
#
# from PIL import Image
#
#
# def convert_image(input_image):
#     """Gets a PIL image file and returns its grayscale version"""
#     img = Image.open(input_image)
#     gray_img = img.convert('L')
#
#
# We also have the main.py file where we call the above function to get grayscale images
# for both the camera image and the uploaded image:
#
# main.py:
#
# # Note: This script runs only on a local IDE with "streamlit run main.py"
# import streamlit as st
#
# from converter import convert_image
#
# st.subheader("Color to Grayscale Converter")
#
# # Create a file uploader component allowing the user to upload a file
# uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("Upload Image")
#
# with st.expander("Start camera"):
#     camera_image = st.camera_input("Camera")
#
# if camera_image:
#     # Supply camera_image to convert_image to get the grayscale version
#     gray_camera_image = convert_image(camera_image)
#     st.image(gray_camera_image)
#
# # Check if the image exists meaning the user has uploaded a file
# if uploaded_image:
#     # Supply camera_image to convert_image to get the grayscale version
#     gray_uploaded_image = convert_image(camera_image)
#     st.image(gray_uploaded_image)
# However, there is one error in one of the above scripts. Hunt it down and fix it.

# import streamlit as st
#
# from converter import convert_image
#
# st.subheader("Color to Grayscale Converter")
#
# # Create a file uploader component allowing the user to upload a file
# uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("Upload Image")
#
# with st.expander("Start camera"):
#     camera_image = st.camera_input("Camera")
#
# if camera_image:
#     # Supply camera_image to convert_image to get the grayscale version
#     gray_camera_image = convert_image(camera_image)
#     st.image(gray_camera_image)
#
# # Check if the image exists meaning the user has uploaded a file
# if uploaded_image:
#     # Supply camera_image to convert_image to get the grayscale version
